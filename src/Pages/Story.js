      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        This project began as a class assignment â€” but quickly turned into something we truly cared about.
        Countless late nights, dozens of bugs, and gallons of coffee later, we built something we're proud of.
      </p>

      <p>
        From designing the frontend components to handling the backend logic and building a fully connected database,
        every step pushed us to think harder and learn faster. Each feature you see came from hard work and dedication.

        Thank you for visiting. We hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed building it.
